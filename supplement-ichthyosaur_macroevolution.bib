  ABSTRACT = {The largest phylogenetic analysis of ichthyosaurs to date is presented, with 114 ingroup taxa coded at species level. Completeness of the taxa included varied from > 98\% to < 2\%; 10 taxa were removed a priori using Concatabominations due to incompleteness and taxonomic uncertainty. The data were analysed using three widely used optimization criteria, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference; while similar, each criterion produced different topologies, support and levels of resolution. Maximum parsimony found a poorly-resolved consensus tree with moderate improvement from a posteriori pruning of unstable taxa; however, general support remained low. Tree resolution was reduced more by taxa that lacked codings from phylogenetically important regions of the tree, rather than by those that simply lacked many codings. Resolution present in the most likely tree is poorly supported; sister relationships cannot be confirmed, although similarities are found to the most parsimonious tree. Bayesian inference found poorly resolved consensus trees. While more resolved, an equal-distribution rate prior is significantly worse than the null gamma-distribution rate prior for morphological data, but suggests rate heterogeneity across ichthyosaur phylogeny. Tree comparisons under each analytical criterion failed to select a single best tree; however, the Bayesian inference tree with gamma-distribution rate prior is selected as the best tree based on recent analyses showing improved accuracy using this criterion. Unequivocally resolved clades include Ichthyopterygia, Ichthyosauria, Shastasauria, Euichthyosauria, Parvipelvia and Neoichthyosauria, but with variation in their taxonomic components. Mixosauridae and Ophthalmosauridae are similarly recovered, but their definitions are modified to stem-based definitions to prevent substantial variation of included taxa. Several genera are not monophyletic: \emph{Brachypterygius, Leptonectes, Mixosaurus, Ophthalmosaurus, Paraophthalmosaurus, Phalarodon, Platypterygius, Stenopterygius, Temnodontosaurus} and \emph{Undorosaurus.} Complex and variable relationships suggest the need for new characters and a re-evaluation of the state of ichthyosaur phylogenetics.},

@ARTICLE{Wills1994,
  ABSTRACT = {Disparity is a measure of the range or significance of morphology in a given sample of organisms, as opposed to diversity, which is expressed in terms of the number (and sometimes ranking) of taxa. At present there is no agreed definition of disparity, much less any consensus on how to measure it. Two possible categories of metric are considered here, one independent of any hypothesis of relationship (phenetics), the other constrained within an evolutionary framework (cladistics). The Early Cambrian radiation was clearly a period of significant morphologic and taxonomic diversification. However, we question the interpretation of its first generation products as numerous body plans at the highest level. Four phenetic and two cladistic measures have been used to compare disparity among Cambrian arthropods with that in the living fauna. Phenetic methods assessing character-state variability and the amount of morphological attribute space occupied yield similar results for Cambrian and Recent arthropods. Assessments of disparity within a taxonomic framework rely on the identification of particular characters that delineate higher level body plans. This requires a phylogenetic interpretation, a cladistic investigation of hierarchical structure in the data. Both sets of arthropods fall within the same major clades, and within this cladistic framework the amount of character-state evolution in the two groups is comparable. None of these methods identifies markedly greater disparity among the Cambrian compared with the Recent taxa. Although measures of disparity are applied here to a consideration of the Cambrian radiation, the metrics clearly have a much wider potential for estimating macroevolutionary trends independently from existing taxonomic frameworks. Geometric morphometry is ideal for measuring morphological variety at lower taxonomic levels, but it requires the recognition of homologous landmarks in all the forms under comparison, or the identification of entire homologous structures. Conventional phenetics has much wider application as it can operate on data coded as discrete homologous character states (this facility is also a requirement of cladistics), which are a more appropriate basis for comparing disparity in markedly dissimilar forms.},

  ABSTRACT = {How much of evolutionary history is lost because of the unevenness of thefossil record? Lagerstätten, sites which have historically yielded exceptionallypreserved fossils, provide remarkable, yet distorting insights into past life.When examining macroevolutionary trends in the fossil record, they can gen-erate an uneven sampling signal for taxonomic diversity; by comparison, theireffect on morphological variety (disparity) is poorly understood. We showhere that lagersta ̈tten impact the disparity of ichthyosaurs, Mesozoic marinereptiles, by preserving higher diversity and more complete specimens. Else-where in the fossil record, undersampled diversity and more fragmentaryspecimens produce spurious results. We identify a novel effect, that a taxonmoves towards the centroid of a Generalized Euclidean dataset as its pro-portion of missing data increases. We term this effect ‘centroid slippage’, asa disparity-based analogue of phylogenetic stemward slippage. Our resultssuggest that uneven sampling presents issues for our view of disparity inthe fossil record, but that this is also dependent on the methodology used,especially true with widely used Generalized Euclidean distances. Mitigationof missing cladistic data is possible by phylogenetic gap filling, and hetero-geneous effects of lagersta ̈tten on disparity may be accounted for byunderstanding the factors affecting their spatio-temporal distribution.},

@ARTICLE{Wills1998,
  ABSTRACT = {Crustaceans have been an important component of marine diversity and biomass since the earliest Phanerozoic. With a relatively well‐documented fossil record, they provide an excellent subject for a continuous study of disparity (≅ bodyplan variety) from the Cambrian to the Recent. A data base of 135 morphological characters forms the basis for cladistic and morphospace studies at the ordinal and sub‐ordinal level. Gross cladistic topology is: (Eumalacostraca + Hoplocarida vs Maxillopoda) vs Phyllopoda (paraphyletic). Each of these groups is of approximately equal disparity, and occupies a distinct region of the morphospace plot. A few problematical fossils (e.g. \emph{Waptia} and \emph{Odaraia}) fall close to the base of the tree. Comparison of the cladogram with stratigraphic range data indicates the location of probable ghost lineages, and randomization procedures provide a statistical test of the goodness of fit of a given set of stratigraphic ranges to a given tree topology. Disparity indices are calculated at series and stage intervals. Observed range data indicate that Cambrian disparity was approximately one third its present level. The Earliest Ordovician saw a marked decrease, with an increase and subsequent plateau through rest of the period. Increases through the Silurian and Devonian corresponded to the radiation of branchiopods, cephalocarids, and latterly the Eumalacostraca and Hoplocarida. By the end of the Carboniferous, observed disparity had reached over four fifths of Recent levels, and the remaining history of the group saw a gradual but slightly irregular increase up until the end of the Tertiary. Indices of disparity incorporating ghost lineages exhibit less marked peaks and troughs, with fewer perturbations overall. Cladistically‐implied disparity in the Lower Cambrian is estimated at three quarters of that in the Recent. Rarefaction is used to compare actual levels of disparity at each time interval with the mean for a similar number of taxa selected randomly from the list of all realized bodyplans. Most intervals preserved a range of forms more disparate than the mean of random samples drawn from the pool of all the taxa considered. From the Triassic to the Recent this difference was intermittently significant. Once occupied, extremes of morphospace tend not to fall vacant again.},

  ABSTRACT = {Ichthyosaurs were important marine predators in the Early Jurassic, and an abundant and diverse component of Mesozoic marine ecosystems. Despite their ecological importance, however, the Early Jurassic species represent a reduced remnant of their former significance in the Triassic. Ichthyosaurs passed through an evolutionary bottleneck at, or close to, the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, which reduced their diversity to as few as three or four lineages. Diversity bounced back to some extent in the aftermath of the end-Triassic mass extinction, but disparity remained at less than one-tenth of pre-extinction levels, and never recovered. The group remained at low diversity and disparity for its final 100 Myr. The end-Triassic mass extinction had a previously unsuspected profound effect in resetting the evolution of apex marine predators of the Mesozoic.},

@ARTICLE{Guillerme2018b,
  ABSTRACT = {1. Biological data is multivariate in essence: many traits in organisms covary with each other in space and time. This causes biologists to either reduce these to a manageable number of variables or, increasingly, to use multivariate toolkits. One such toolkit is based on creating a multidimensional space where the variables are the axes. It is then possible to measure diverse aspects of the distribution of some observation (e.g. species) in this space. For example, if studying morphology, one can create a morphospace for two groups of species, measure the volume occupied by each of these groups and then test whether these two volumes are significantly different or not. 2. There are as many definitions of these multidimensional spaces, metrics and tests as there are questions that can be tackled with such methods. Many of these methods are implemented in specific software or r packages. However, the definition of the space, metric and test is often dependent on the software/package and authors points of view or specific questions. This can unfortunately hamper researchers' ability to apply different methods that best suits their specific questions. 3. Here I present the dispRity package, a flexible R package for performing multidimensional analysis. It allows users to define each step of the analysis (whether it is the space, the metric or the test) through a highly modular architecture where each definition can be passed as a function. It also provides a tidy interface through the dispRity object, allowing users to easily run reproducible multivariate analysis. 4. The dispRity package also comes with an extend manual regularly updated following users' questions or suggestions. Furthermore, the package contains some simulation tools (e.g to simulate complex multidimensional space or morphological data). Finally, it also contains a suite of utility functions to work with dispRity objects aimed at helping users to develop their own multidimensional metrics and/or tests.},

@ARTICLE{Marek2015,
  ABSTRACT = {Even after 200 years of study, some details of the cranial anatomy of ichthyosaurs, one of the most successful groups of marine vertebrates in the Mesozoic, are still unclear. New information on the braincase, palate and occiput are provided from three‐dimensional scans of an exceptionally preserved ichthyosaur (\emph{'Hauffiopteryx' typicus}) skull from the Toarcian (183--174 Ma, Lower Jurassic) of Strawberry Bank, England. This ichthyosaur has unusual, hollow, tubular hyoid bars. The occipital and braincase region is fully reconstructed, creating the first digital cranial endocast of an ichthyosaur. Enlarged optic lobes and an enlarged cerebellum suggest neuroanatomical adaptations that allowed it to be a highly mobile, visual predator. The olfactory region also appears to be enlarged, suggesting that olfaction was more important for ichthyosaurs than has been assumed. Phylogenetic analysis suggests this ichthyosaur is closely related to, but distinct from, \emph{Hauffiopteryx,} and positioned within Thunnosauria, a more derived position than previously recovered. These results further our knowledge of ichthyosaur cranial anatomy in three dimensions and provide a platform in which to study the anatomical adaptations that allowed ichthyosaurs to dominate the marine realm during the Mesozoic.},

  ABSTRACT = {The ichthyosaur material of the British Middle and Upper Jurassic referable to \emph{Ophthalmosaurus icenicus} (Ichthyosauria: Ophthalmosauridae) is revisited and re-described; this is the most completely known post-Liassic British ichthyosaur. Much of this material derives from the Callovian Oxford Clay Formation, particularly from the Peterborough Area of Cambridgeshire, UK, deposited in the Leeds Collections. Pre-Callovian ichthyosaur remains are infrequent, incomplete, and non-diagnostic. Material referred to \emph{Ophthalmosaurus icenicus} shows high variability in the extent of ossification. Based on examination of the type and referred material, \emph{Ophthalmosaurus monocharactus} and \emph{Ophthalmosaurus pleydelli} are rejected as junior subjective synonyms of \emph{Ophthalmosaurus icenicus} due to a lack of diagnostic characters and pathology of specimens. \emph{Ichthyosaurus megalodeirus} is rejected as a \emph{nomen nudum} and the type material is referred to \emph{Ophthalmosaurus icenicus.} \emph{Ophthalmosaurus icenicus} is considered a separate species from \emph{Ophthalmosaurus natans} based on several autapomorphies, but requires re-evaluation of the material.},

  ABSTRACT = {Vertebrate evolution has led to the convergent appearance of many groups of originally terrestrial animals that now live in the sea. Among these groups are familiar mammals like whales, dolphins, and seals. There are also reptilian lineages (like plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, thalattosaurs, and others) that have become sea creatures. Most of these marine reptiles, often wrongly called "dinosaurs", are extinct. This edited book is devoted to these extinct groups of marine reptiles. These reptilian analogs represent useful models of the myriad adaptations that permit tetrapods to live in the ocean.},

  ABSTRACT = {Background The Middle Jurassic was a critical time in the evolutionary history of ichthyosaurs. During this time interval, the diverse, well-studied faunas of the Lower Jurassic were entirely replaced by ophthalmosaurids, a new group that arose sometime prior to the Aalenian-Bajocian boundary and by the latest middle Jurassic comprised the only surviving group of ichthyosaurs. Thus, the Middle Jurassic Aalenian-Bathonian interval (176--165 million years ago) comprises the time frame during which ophthalmosaurids not only originated but also achieved taxonomic dominance. However, diagnostic ichthyosaur remains have been described previously from only a single locality from this interval, from the Bajocian of Argentina. Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper, we describe a new species of ichthyosaur based on a partial articulated specimen from the Middle Jurassic of southwestern Germany. This specimen was recovered from the Opalinuston Formation (early Aalenian) and is referable to Stenopterygius aaleniensis sp. nov. reflecting features of the skull and forefin. The genus Stenopterygius is diverse and abundant in the Lower Jurassic of Europe, but its presence has not previously been confirmed in younger (Middle Jurassic) rocks from the northern hemisphere. Conclusions/Significance This specimen represents the only diagnostic ichthyosaur remains reported from the Aalenian. It bears numerous similarities in size and in morphology to the Lower Jurassic species of the genus Stenopterygius and provides additional evidence that the major ecological changes hypothesized to have occurred at the end of the Toarcian took place sometime after this point and most likely did not occur suddenly. There is currently no evidence for the presence of ophthalmosaurids in the northern hemisphere during the Aalenian-Bathonian interval.},

  ABSTRACT = {Ichthyosaurs represent one of the most highly specialized lineages of marine reptiles, but ourunderstanding of the evolution of this group is based on specimens found at a surprisingly small number ofstratigraphic intervals and localities. The Lower Jurassic (Toarcian) Posidonia Shale of southwestern Germany isone of the richest ichthyosaur-bearing formations in the world and has produced thousands of skeletons, includingspecimens with preserved soft tissue, and fetal remains inside the body cavity. The most abundant ichthyosaur genusin the Posidonia Shale isStenopterygius. In spite of almost 200 years of research effort, the number of species in thisgenus is still a point of active disagreement in the literature. Here, bivariate and multivariate analyses are used toclassify both articulated and disarticulated skeletons to the level of species, using measurement data from individualcranial and postcranial elements. Unlike previous classification attempts, this technique pinpoints ontogeneticallyconserved differences in size and proportion between the species, and so can be applied to adult, subadult, andneonatal specimens. Using this method, three species ofStenopterygius, S. quadriscissus, S. triscissus,andS. uniterare differentiated.},

  ABSTRACT = {The biotic recovery from Earth's most severe extinction event at the Permian-Triassic boundary largely reestablished the preextinction structure of marine trophic networks, with marine reptiles assuming the predator roles. However, the highest trophic level of today's marine ecosystems, i.e., macropredatory tetrapods that forage on prey of similar size to their own, was thus far lacking in the Paleozoic and early Mesozoic. Here we report a top-tier tetrapod predator, a very large (>8.6 m) ichthyosaur from the early Middle Triassic (244 Ma), of Nevada. This ichthyosaur had a massive skull and large labiolingually flattened teeth with two cutting edges indicative of a macropredatory feeding style. Its presence documents the rapid evolution of modern marine ecosystems in the Triassic where the same level of complexity as observed in today's marine ecosystems is reached within 8 My after the Permian-Triassic mass extinction and within 4 My of the time reptiles first invaded the sea. This find also indicates that the biotic recovery in the marine realm may have occurred faster compared with terrestrial ecosystems, where the first apex predators may not have evolved before the Carnian.},
