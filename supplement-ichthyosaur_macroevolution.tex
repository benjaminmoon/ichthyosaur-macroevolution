\section{Supplementary methods}\label{supplemental-methods}

\paragraph{Comparison of time-scaling methods}\label{comparison-of-time-scaling-methods}

To assess the effects of variation in the timing of ichthyosaur evolution on
discrete evolutionary rates, we further used the minimum branch length (MBL)
tree-scaling method \autocite{Bapst2012MEE, Laurin2004SB}. This scales the
tree according to occurrence dates, but ensures that each branch length is
greater than a given value, rescaling ancestral branches as necessary to ensure
this minimum length. Here, we used a MBL of \SI{1}{\mega\annum} as a reasonable
minimum between speciation events and to avoid forcing excessive branch lengths
where speciation may occur rapidly. We used the same sample of 120 phylogenetic
trees as the main analysis from the Bayesian phylogenetic posterior distribution
of \textcite{Moon2018JSP}. Trees were time-scaled in R \autocite{RCoreTeam2019} using the
function \texttt{timePaleoPhy} in the package paleotree \autocite{Bapst2012MEE}
with point ages sampled from a uniform distribution between their first and last
occurrences. Each tree was resampled 10 times to account for the occurrence
ranges for each taxon (100 tree topologies × 10 samples = 1000 time-scaled trees
total). These MBL time-scaled trees were then used for a further set of discrete
character evolutionary rates analyses using function
\texttt{DiscreteCharacterRate} of R package Claddis \autocite{Lloyd2016BJLS}. The
results of this were used to produce `spaghetti' plots for epoch-length bins and
equal-length bins using modified scripts from \textcite{Close2015CB}. Code for
all these analyses is included in \cref{disparity-discrete-code}.

\paragraph{Additional disparity metrics}

Our main results present ichthyosauriform disparity using per-bin pairwise
differences between taxa from a distance matrix calculated using maximum
observed rescaled distances \autocite{Lloyd2016BJLS}. Additionally, we compared
different distance conversion and disparity metrics.

\indent Claddis provides four distance metrics for discrete character data
\autocite{Lloyd2016BJLS}: raw Euclidean distances (RAW), generalized Euclidean
distances (GED) \autocite{Wills1994P}, Gower's coefficient (GOW)
\autocite{Gower1971B}, and maximum observable rescaled distances (MAX)
\autocite{Lloyd2016BJLS}. All four distance metrics were run through the same
disparity work flow. Recent studies have shown that GED as implemented in
Claddis is susceptible to the completeness of the original data matrix, which
may have a strong effect on the resulting disparity
\autocite{FlannerySutherland2019PRSBBS, Lehmann2019P}; therefore we prefer MAX\@.

Similarly, several different disparity metrics have been developed, each with
varying properties. Our main results present mean and weighted mean pairwise
distances on MAX as this comes directly from the original data matrix, but we
also calculated the pairwise distances for RAW, GED, and GOW distances matrices
\pcref{fig:pairwise-disparity}. We ordinated the data using Principal
Coordinates Analysis (PCA), both with and without applying a correction to
negative eigenvalues \autocite{Caillez1983P} and compared the correlation of the
PCA data with the original distance matrix. 

From the PCA data we used all the resultant axes to calculate per-bin sum of
variances, sum of ranges, and centroid distances. These metrics have been used
extensively in previous analyses \autocite{Wills1998BJLS, Thorne2011PNAS,
FlannerySutherland2019PRSBBS}, so we considered it pertinent to compare them.
Binning, bootstrap resampling with 500 replicates, and complete rarefaction
were completed using the functions \texttt{custom.subsets} and
\texttt{boot.matrix}, and disparity calculations used the function
\texttt{dispRity}, all from package dispRity \autocite{Guillerme2018MEE} in R.
Code for this is included in \cref{disparity-discrete-code}.


\section{Supplementary results}\label{sec:supplemental-results}

\paragraph{Pairwise disparity}\label{par:pairwise-disparity}

Broadly speaking, trends in disparity across all four distance matrices are
similar: disparity peaks in the Late Triassic then declines through the Jurassic
and Cretaceous \pcref{fig:pairwise-disparity}. The bins that preserve the most
completely coded taxa (\cref{fig:pairwise-disparity} CHAR\@: Early Jurassic;
\SIrange{201.3}{171.3}{\mega\annum}) also show relatively increased disparity in
RAW and GED distance matrices compared to GOW and MAX\@. Indeed, the earliest
Jurassic bins are the most disparate for the RAW distance metric with both
binning schemes, and for GED the earliest Jurassic bins have relatively higher
disparity than GOW and MAX distance matrices. This is most likely a further
effect of incompleteness degrading the disparity signal by averaging the
difference between taxa \autocite{FlannerySutherland2019PRSBBS, Lehmann2019P},
therefore we prefer the results given by GOW and MAX distance matrices.
Rarefying the data shows that maximum disparity is reach quickly with minimal
taxa included, and supports using the full taxon sample for each bin
\pcref{fig:pd-rarefaction-curves}.

\paragraph{Correlation of ordinated data}\label{par:pco-correlation}

Negative eigenvalue correction notably decreased the variance described by the
first few principal coordinate axes \cref{fig:ordination-correlation}. The
highest correlations between the original and ordinated data were found when
including all ordinated axes \pcref{fig:ordination-correlation}. Without
negative eigenvalue correction RAW and GED had the highest correlation, whereas
GOW and MAX were reduced to \textasciitilde{}0.8. With negative eigenvalue
correction the pattern of correlations with increasing number of axes was more
complex: RAW gradually increased whereas GED strongly decreased, but both
rapidly increased to 1.0 with the last axes; GOW and MAX correlations both
immediately decreased, increased to a peak at \textasciitilde{}axis 60, then
rapidly increased again when including the last axes.

\paragraph{Disparity of ordinated data}\label{par:ordinated-disparity}

\textcite{Wills1998BJLS} asserted that variance based disparity metrics are more
suited to measuring overall dissimilarity whereas range-based metrics are
appropriate for disparity as they are affected by occurrence and thus show the
diversification of morphology. In this context, our results support our
conclusions that ichthyosaurs represent an early burst of evolution: both of
these metrics show initial high disparity from all distance matrices
(\cref{fig:ordinated-disparity}). Sum of variances also has a marked increase
between the Early to Middle Triassic and a substantial decline in disparity
between the Late Triassic–Early Jurassic in the combination of GOW/MAX distance
matrix and uncorrected PCO\@; otherwise all curves follow similar trends. Sum of
variances proves more resilient to sample size in rarefaction than either sum of
ranges or centroid distance (\cref{fig:rarefaction-curves}).

All sum of ranges curves display the same trends in disparity, differing only in
the magnitude. Similarly, we find early high disparity and an increase between
the Early–Middle Triassic (\cref{fig:ordinated-disparity}). Disparity decreases
substantially through the later Triassic, but broadly recovers in the Early
Jurassic before more log-term decline through to the extinction of the
ichthyosaurs. Particularly low disparity (e.g. Middle Jurassic;
\SIrange{171.3} {161.3}{\mega\annum}) are those bins represented by few taxa and
relative incompleteness.

In the case of centroid distance, although this has been shown to be especially
susceptible to issues of `centroid slippage'
\autocite{FlannerySutherland2019PRSBBS, Lehmann2019P}, our results show the same
trends as for sum of variances: high early disparity that is sustained through
to the Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous before decline, with dips that are most
likely related to incompleteness of specimens (\cref{fig:ordinated-disparity}).

\paragraph{Morphospace occupation of ordinated data}\label{par:ordinated-morphospace}

Morphospace occupation between Triassic and post-Triassic Ichthyosauriformes is
separated in almost all cases (\cref{fig:morphospace-plots}; except RAW and GED
distances). Late Triassic taxa are also separated from earlier Triassic taxa in
GOW and MAX distance without negative eigenvalue correction, and are
consistently positioned more closely towards the Early Jurassic taxa. The
variation in Jurassic and Cretaceous taxa is markedly increased in RAW and GED
distances relative to GOW and MAX\@. Differences within Jurassic and Cretaceous
taxa are more represented in PCo axis 2 than axis 3 in the RAW and GED
morphospace plots, but in a combination of PCO axes 1 and 3 in GOW and MAX\@. All
RAW and GED morphospace plots show more points towards the origins of the plots
than GOW and MAX, a results of `centroid slippage'
\autocite{FlannerySutherland2019PRSBBS, Lehmann2019P}; in particular these represent
the least complete taxa.

\paragraph{Time-scaling and rates}\label{par:mbl-scaling-rates}

Using the MBL time-scaling method created trees with a root age of
\SIrange{253.8}{268.5}{\mega\annum}; older than the corresponding root ages from
the Hedman scaling method. Rates of discrete character evolution are relatively
lower for during the Early–Middle Triassic, but these earlier bins nonetheless
show significantly higher rates of evolution that subsequent bins
\pcref{fig:mbl-discrete-rates}. Trends across the whole of ichthyosaur evolution
remain similar, although there are increased peaks in the later Early Jurassic
and the Late Cretaceous bins. Significantly low rates of discrete character
evolution are reached in the Early Jurassic (epoch bins) or Late Triassic
(\SI{10}{\mega\annum} bins).
